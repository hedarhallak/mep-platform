# Constrai — Architectural Decisions & Pending Work

> This file documents every agreed architectural decision + all planned work not yet implemented.
> At the start of every conversation: read MASTER_README.md then DECISIONS.md
> Raw URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hedarhallak/mep-platform/main/DECISIONS.md

## How to Use This File

- ✅ **Implemented** — done and tested
- 🔄 **In Progress** — work started
- 🟡 **Planned — High Priority** — agreed, not yet implemented
- 🔵 **Planned — Medium Priority** — agreed, later
- 💡 **Future Idea** — documented, not in near plan
- ❌ **Never delete ideas** — when two similar ideas exist, keep both and merge when discussing

---

## Working Rules — Decision Documentation

> **Every architectural or design decision agreed during conversation → document in DECISIONS.md immediately. Never rely on memory.**
> Claude cannot see previous conversations — DECISIONS.md is the only shared memory.

## 1. Role & Permission System ✅

### Core Principle:
- **PERMISSIONS** — fixed in code, developer adds only when new feature is built
- **ROLES** — fully flexible, SUPER_ADMIN adds/edits from UI without code
- **Permission-to-role mapping** — from UI, no code needed
- **Role assignment to user** — UPDATE in DB from UI
- Adding a new role or editing its permissions = UI only, no developer needed

```
PERMISSIONS (fixed in code)
    ↓
ROLES (flexible — from UI)
    ↓
USERS (assigned role by COMPANY_ADMIN)
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

---

## 2. Mobile App Architecture (April 2026) ✅

### UI Law — Icon Grid Navigation:
> **Every screen in the app uses icon grid navigation (same design as Dashboard). No tabs, no separate buttons, no lists. Every action or section = icon card.**
> This applies to: Materials, Tasks, My Hub, My Report, and all future sub-screens.

### Shared Component:
- `src/screens/shared/SubMenuScreen.tsx` — reusable icon grid, identical design to DashboardScreen
- **Rule: Never build two screens with the same design. Always use SubMenuScreen with different props.**

### Navigation Structure:
```
Bottom Bar: Home · Hub · Profile

Home → DashboardScreen (icon grid, role-aware)
  → Attendance
  → Materials → MaterialsMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → New Request
      → My Requests
  → Tasks (FOREMAN+) → TasksMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → New Task (full form: project, recipients, photo, priority, due date)
      → Sent Tasks (completion tracking with photos)
  → Report → ReportMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → This Week
      → Last Week
      → Custom Date
  → Assignments (Soon)
  → Standup (Soon)
  → Purchase Orders (Soon)

Hub → HubMenuScreen (icon grid)
  → Inbox (tasks + notifications archive)
  → Material Requests (FOREMAN+) → merge + edit + send PO
```

### My Hub Philosophy:
> My Hub = Inbox only. Like email. Receives tasks, material notifications.
> After processing → stays as archive.
> Sending tasks → from Dashboard → Tasks → New Task
> Processing materials → from Hub → Material Requests → Merge & Edit

### Materials Flow (Foreman):
```
Worker submits request → stored with foreman_employee_id
Foreman sees in Hub → Material Requests
Foreman selects requests → Merged Preview (auto SUM by item_name)
Foreman taps "Merge & Edit" → MergeEditScreen (edit qty, delete items, choose destination)
Foreman sends → POST /api/materials/send-order → PO created + email sent
requests status → SENT
```

## 3. Organizational Structure ✅

| Role | Reports To | Note |
|---|---|---|
| COMPANY_ADMIN | Owner | Top of company |
| TRADE_PROJECT_MANAGER | TRADE_ADMIN or higher | Cross-trade oversight |
| TRADE_ADMIN | FOREMAN level up | Trade supervisor |
| FOREMAN | Reports to TRADE_ADMIN | Field leader |

```

---

## 6. Bilingual Support (EN/FR) 🟡

### Decision:
- **UI Language** → user chooses (EN or FR) per device
- **Official Documents** (PO, emails to suppliers) → follows Company Language setting
- **Task Messages** → follows sender's language

### Company Language Setting:
- COMPANY_ADMIN sets company official language in Settings
- All PDFs, PO emails, official correspondence → generated in company language
- Rationale: Quebec Law 101 requires French for official business documents

### Implementation Plan (when ready):
- Library: react-i18next
- Setup: 1 day
- Mobile UI translation: 2-3 days
- Web UI translation: 2-3 days
- PDF/email templates in FR: 1-2 days
- **Total estimate: ~1 week**

### Note:
> Many Quebec companies communicate internally in English even under Law 101.
> Solution: UI language = user choice. Documents language = company setting.
> This handles all cases without forcing one language.

---

## 7. Custom Job Titles per Company 🔵

### Idea:
Each company defines its own job title names mapped to permission levels.

### Example:
```
Company A: "Chef d'équipe" = FOREMAN level (40)
Company B: "Site Supervisor" = FOREMAN level (40)
Company C: "Contremaître" = FOREMAN level (40)
```

### Implementation:
- New table: `company_roles` (company_id, display_name, base_role, level)
- UI in Settings → Custom Roles
- Existing 13 roles become "base templates"
- Display name overrides in all UI + PDFs

### Status: 🔵 Planned — design discussion needed before implementation

---

## 8. Material Return / Surplus System 🔵

### Idea (April 2026):
A smart system to reduce material waste and cost by routing surplus materials between projects before ordering from supplier.

### Flow:
```
1. Foreman declares surplus materials at project site
2. System creates a "Return Request" with status: WAITING (3-day holding period)
3. System sends notification to ALL Foremen across ALL active projects:
   "Surplus materials available: [list of items]"
4. Any Foreman can claim items they need within 3 days
5. Driver is dispatched to transfer materials between projects
6. After 3 days with no claim → materials go to supplier return or warehouse
7. When new PO is being created → system checks for available surplus first
   and alerts Foreman: "These items may be available from surplus: [list]"
```

### Benefits:
- Reduces supplier orders and costs
- Reduces waste ("throw it away" problem)
- Reduces warehouse storage pressure
- Creates internal supply chain visibility

### New Screens Needed:
- Dashboard → "Surplus" icon (FOREMAN+)
  - Declare Surplus
  - Available Surplus (from other projects)
- Hub → notification when surplus matches pending request

### DB Tables Needed:
- `material_surplus_requests` (project_id, items, status, expires_at)
- `material_surplus_claims` (surplus_id, claiming_project_id, claiming_foreman_id, items_claimed)

### Status: 🔵 Planned — detailed design session needed

---

## 9. CCQ Labor Marketplace 💡

### Idea (April 2026):
A platform extension where:
- Companies post job openings
- Workers post their availability and skills
- CCQ (union) acts as intermediary/validator

### Differentiation from existing job boards:
- CCQ-verified workers (union membership validation)
- Trade-specific matching (PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, etc.)
- Integration with existing attendance/assignment history
- Skill level matching (JOURNEYMAN, APPRENTICE level, etc.)

### Note:
> This is a significant product extension — essentially a separate product built on top of MEP Platform.
> Not in near-term roadmap. Document and revisit when core platform is stable.

### Status: 💡 Future idea — keep documented, discuss when core is complete

---

## 10. Smart Assignment System 🔵

### Concept:
Automatic assignment suggestions based on:
- Worker proximity to project site (home_lat/home_lng vs site_lat/site_lng)
- Worker trade matching project needs
- Current workload and availability
- CCQ rules compliance

### Current State:
- PostGIS installed ✅
- home_lat/home_lng in employee_profiles ✅
- site_lat/site_lng in projects ✅
- Workforce Planner BI feature shows distance optimization ✅

### Next Steps:
- Build auto-suggestion endpoint
- UI to accept/reject suggestions
- Driver routing optimization for material transfers

### Status: 🔵 Planned — depends on Smart Assignment design session

---

## 11. Decisions About Ideas Management

> **Rule: Never delete any idea from this file.**
> When two similar ideas exist → keep both, note the similarity, merge during dedicated discussion.
> Example: Material surplus system (Section 8) and Smart Assignment proximity (Section 10) both use geographic data — they should be discussed together for a unified geo-intelligence layer.
