# Constrai — Architectural Decisions & Pending Work

> This file documents every agreed architectural decision + all planned work not yet implemented.
> At the start of every conversation: read MASTER_README.md then DECISIONS.md
> Raw URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hedarhallak/mep-platform/main/DECISIONS.md

## How to Use This File

- ✅ **Implemented** — done and tested
- 🔄 **In Progress** — work started
- 🟡 **Planned — High Priority** — agreed, not yet implemented
- 🔵 **Planned — Medium Priority** — agreed, later
- 💡 **Future Idea** — documented, not in near plan
- ❌ **Never delete ideas** — when two similar ideas exist, keep both and merge when discussing

---

## Working Rules — Decision Documentation

> **Every architectural or design decision agreed during conversation → document in DECISIONS.md immediately. Never rely on memory.**
> Claude cannot see previous conversations — DECISIONS.md is the only shared memory.

## 1. Role & Permission System ✅

### Core Principle:
- **PERMISSIONS** — fixed in code, developer adds only when new feature is built
- **ROLES** — fully flexible, SUPER_ADMIN adds/edits from UI without code
- **Permission-to-role mapping** — from UI, no code needed
- **Role assignment to user** — UPDATE in DB from UI
- Adding a new role or editing its permissions = UI only, no developer needed

```
PERMISSIONS (fixed in code)
    ↓
ROLES (flexible — from UI)
    ↓
USERS (assigned role by COMPANY_ADMIN)
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

---

### 13 Roles (April 2026):

| Role | Level | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SUPER_ADMIN | 100 | Constrai internal only |
| IT_ADMIN | 90 | Technical admin |
| COMPANY_ADMIN | 80 | Company owner/manager |

## 2. Mobile App Architecture (April 2026) ✅

### UI Law — Icon Grid Navigation:
> **Every screen in the app uses icon grid navigation (same design as Dashboard). No tabs, no separate buttons, no lists. Every action or section = icon card.**
> This applies to: Materials, Tasks, My Hub, My Report, and all future sub-screens.

### Shared Component:
- `src/screens/shared/SubMenuScreen.tsx` — reusable icon grid, identical design to DashboardScreen
- **Rule: Never build two screens with the same design. Always use SubMenuScreen with different props.**

### Navigation Structure:
```
Bottom Bar: Home · Hub · Profile

Home → DashboardScreen (icon grid, role-aware)
  → Attendance
  → Materials → MaterialsMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → New Request
      → My Requests
  → Tasks (FOREMAN+) → TasksMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → New Task (full form: project, recipients, photo, priority, due date)
      → Sent Tasks (completion tracking with photos)
  → Report → ReportMenuScreen (icon grid)
      → This Week
      → Last Week
      → Custom Date
  → Assignments (Soon)
  → Standup (Soon)
  → Purchase Orders (Soon)

Hub → HubMenuScreen (icon grid)
  → Inbox (tasks + notifications archive)
  → Material Requests (FOREMAN+) → merge + edit + send PO
```

### My Hub Philosophy:
> My Hub = Inbox only. Like email. Receives tasks, material notifications.
> After processing → stays as archive.
> Sending tasks → from Dashboard → Tasks → New Task
> Processing materials → from Hub → Material Requests → Merge & Edit

### Materials Flow (Foreman):
```
Worker submits request → stored with foreman_employee_id
Foreman sees in Hub → Material Requests
Foreman selects requests → Merged Preview (auto SUM by item_name)
Foreman taps "Merge & Edit" → MergeEditScreen (edit qty, delete items, choose destination)
Foreman sends → POST /api/materials/send-order → PO created + email sent
requests status → SENT
```

## 3. Organizational Structure ✅

| Role | Reports To | Note |
|---|---|---|
| COMPANY_ADMIN | Owner | Top of company |
| TRADE_PROJECT_MANAGER | TRADE_ADMIN or higher | Cross-trade oversight |
| TRADE_ADMIN | FOREMAN level up | Trade supervisor |
| FOREMAN | Reports to TRADE_ADMIN | Field leader |

---

## 6. Bilingual Support (EN/FR) 🔄

### Decision:
- **UI Language** → user chooses (EN or FR) per device
- **Official Documents** (PO, emails to suppliers) → follows Company Language setting
- **Task Messages** → follows sender's language

### Company Language Setting:
- COMPANY_ADMIN sets company official language in Settings
- All PDFs, PO emails, official correspondence → generated in company language
- Rationale: Quebec Law 101 requires French for official business documents

### Implementation Status:
| Layer | Status | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile — library setup (react-i18next) | ✅ | Apr 14, 2026 |
| Mobile — all screens + headers | ✅ | Apr 15, 2026 |
| Mobile — localized dates (fr-CA / en-CA) | ✅ | Apr 15, 2026 |
| Mobile — Profile → Language switcher | ✅ | Apr 14, 2026 |
| Web Frontend — library setup | 🟡 | — |
| Web Frontend — all pages | 🟡 | — |
| PDF templates (PO, reports) in FR | 🟡 | — |
| Email templates (supplier orders) in FR | 🟡 | — |
| Company language setting UI | 🟡 | — |

### Mobile i18n Technical Notes:
- Library: `react-i18next` v4 (compatibility v3 mode removed)
- Language detector: Custom AsyncStorage detector, key `mep_language`
- Default language: French (FR), fallback: EN
- Files: `src/i18n/index.ts`, `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`, `src/i18n/locales/fr.ts`
- Sections: common, auth, dashboard, modules, attendance, materials, tasks, hub, report, profile, roles, errors
- Date/time locale: dynamic via `i18n.language === 'fr' ? 'fr-CA' : 'en-CA'`

### Note:
> Many Quebec companies communicate internally in English even under Law 101.
> Solution: UI language = user choice. Documents language = company setting.
> This handles all cases without forcing one language.

---

## 7. Custom Job Titles per Company 🔵

### Idea:
Each company defines its own job title names mapped to permission levels.

### Example:
```
Company A: "Chef d'équipe" = FOREMAN level (40)
Company B: "Site Supervisor" = FOREMAN level (40)
Company C: "Contremaître" = FOREMAN level (40)
```

### Implementation:
- New table: `company_roles` (company_id, display_name, base_role, level)
- UI in Settings → Custom Roles
- Existing 13 roles become "base templates"
- Display name overrides in all UI + PDFs

### Status: 🔵 Planned — design discussion needed before implementation

---

## 8. Material Return / Surplus System 🔵

### Idea (April 2026):
A smart system to reduce material waste and cost by routing surplus materials between projects before ordering from supplier.

### Flow:
```
1. Foreman declares surplus materials at project site
2. System creates a "Return Request" with status: WAITING (3-day holding period)
3. System sends notification to ALL Foremen across ALL active projects:
   "Surplus materials available: [list of items]"
4. Any Foreman can claim items they need within 3 days
5. Driver is dispatched to transfer materials between projects
6. After 3 days with no claim → materials go to supplier return or warehouse
7. When new PO is being created → system checks for available surplus first
   and alerts Foreman: "These items may be available from surplus: [list]"
```

### Benefits:
- Reduces supplier orders and costs
- Reduces waste ("throw it away" problem)
- Reduces warehouse storage pressure
- Creates internal supply chain visibility

### New Screens Needed:
- Dashboard → "Surplus" icon (FOREMAN+)
  - Declare Surplus
  - Available Surplus (from other projects)
- Hub → notification when surplus matches pending request

### DB Tables Needed:
- `material_surplus_requests` (project_id, items, status, expires_at)
- `material_surplus_claims` (surplus_id, claiming_project_id, claiming_foreman_id, items_claimed)

### Status: 🔵 Planned — detailed design session needed

---

## 9. CCQ Labor Marketplace 💡

### Idea (April 2026):
A platform extension where:
- Companies post job openings
- Workers post their availability and skills
- CCQ (union) acts as intermediary/validator

### Differentiation from existing job boards:
- CCQ-verified workers (union membership validation)
- Trade-specific matching (PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, etc.)
- Integration with existing attendance/assignment history
- Skill level matching (JOURNEYMAN, APPRENTICE level, etc.)

### Note:
> This is a significant product extension — essentially a separate product built on top of MEP Platform.
> Not in near-term roadmap. Document and revisit when core platform is stable.

### Status: 💡 Future idea — keep documented, discuss when core is complete

---

## 10. Smart Assignment System 🔵

### Concept:
Automatic assignment suggestions based on:
- Worker proximity to project site (home_lat/home_lng vs site_lat/site_lng)
- Worker trade matching project needs
- Current workload and availability
- CCQ rules compliance

### Current State:
- PostGIS installed ✅
- home_lat/home_lng in employee_profiles ✅
- site_lat/site_lng in projects ✅
- Workforce Planner BI feature shows distance optimization ✅

### Next Steps:
- Build auto-suggestion endpoint
- UI to accept/reject suggestions
- Driver routing optimization for material transfers

### Status: 🔵 Planned — depends on Smart Assignment design session

---

## 11. Session Log — April 15, 2026

### Completed:
- Fixed `Property 't' doesn't exist` TypeScript error (root cause: SubMenuScreen props mismatch)

## 13. Decisions About Ideas Management

> **Rule: Never delete any idea from this file.**
> When two similar ideas exist → keep both, note the similarity, merge during dedicated discussion.
> Example: Material surplus system (Section 8) and Smart Assignment proximity (Section 10) both use geographic data — they should be discussed together for a unified geo-intelligence layer.

---

## 14. Disaster Recovery & Bus-Factor Mitigation 🔄

### Context (April 18, 2026):
The mobile dev tooling crashed and had to be reinstalled — some uncommitted local work was lost.
This raised two real risks that need to be hardened:
1. **Data loss** — no automated DB backups existed; a corrupted DB or destroyed Droplet would lose everything.
2. **Bus factor = 1** — every account, password, and piece of operational knowledge lives only in Hedar's head + laptop. If Hedar is unavailable, the business stops.

### Strategy:
Defense in depth across three layers — data, infrastructure, and human knowledge.

### Layer 1 — Data (DB backups) ✅
- Daily pg_dump → DigitalOcean Spaces (`constrai-backups`, NYC3)
- Retention: 7 daily + 4 weekly + 3 monthly
- Restore tested via `restore_db.sh` (always restore to a different DB name first, then swap)
- Scripts: `scripts/backup/{backup_db.sh, cleanup_old_backups.sh, restore_db.sh}`
- Config: `/etc/mep-backup.env` (chmod 600, root)
- Setup guide: `scripts/backup/SETUP.md`
- Optional: healthchecks.io dead-man's-switch for failure alerts

### Layer 2 — Infrastructure 🟡
- 🟡 DigitalOcean weekly Droplet snapshots — enable in dashboard
- 🟡 SSL auto-renew verification (quarterly `certbot renew --dry-run`)
- 🟡 Commit Nginx config template + `.env.example` to repo

### Layer 3 — Human Knowledge & Access 🟡
- 🟡 Password manager (Bitwarden / 1Password) holding ALL credentials — see `RECOVERY.md` Section 2.1 for required inventory
- 🟡 Emergency access for one trusted contact (spouse / business partner / lawyer with sealed envelope)
- 🟡 Second GitHub collaborator with admin rights
- 🟡 Apple ID recovery contacts (2FA backup)
- 🟡 Eventually: Apple Developer Organization account (vs current Individual)
- 🟡 Eventually: second developer/contractor onboarded and given `RECOVERY.md`

### Operational Rule:
- **Quarterly** (1st of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct): run the verification checklist in `RECOVERY.md` Section 8.
- **After every infra change**: update `RECOVERY.md`.

### Status: 🔄 In progress — backup automation deployed, hardening items pending (see `RECOVERY.md` Section 10)

---

## 15. Session Log — April 18, 2026

### Context:
Mobile dev environment crashed on Hedar's laptop and had to be reinstalled. Some uncommitted work was lost. Triggered a discussion about disaster recovery and bus-factor risk.

### Completed:
- Created automated DB backup pipeline:
  - `scripts/backup/backup_db.sh` — pg_dump + sanity checks + gzip + upload to Spaces
  - `scripts/backup/cleanup_old_backups.sh` — applies 7/4/3 retention
  - `scripts/backup/restore_db.sh` — interactive restore with safety guards (blocks accidental overwrite of `mepdb`)
  - `scripts/backup/SETUP.md` — full server setup guide (DigitalOcean Spaces config, s3cmd, cron)
- Created `RECOVERY.md` at repo root — comprehensive DR playbook covering:
  - Credential inventory (password manager requirements)
  - DB recovery procedure (RPO 24h / RTO 30min)
  - Server recovery (snapshot restore + full rebuild from scratch)
  - Domain / SSL recovery
  - Mobile app recovery (Apple/Expo single points of failure)
  - GitHub recovery
  - Quarterly verification checklist
  - Prioritized hardening TODO list
- Updated `DECISIONS.md`:
  - Added Section 14 (DR & Bus-Factor)
  - Added technical decisions for backup tooling
  - Added Section 15 (this session log)

### Pending (next steps for Hedar):
- Execute `scripts/backup/SETUP.md` Parts 1–2 (create Spaces bucket, configure server, run first backup)
- Execute `scripts/backup/SETUP.md` Part 3 (one-time restore test to validate backups are usable)
- Begin working through `RECOVERY.md` Section 10 — Critical hardening items (password manager emergency access, Apple ID recovery contacts, Droplet snapshots, second GitHub admin)

### Pending Discussion (future sessions):
- Second technical contact — who, what level of involvement, NDA?
- Apple Developer Organization account transition — requires business entity decisions
- Web Frontend i18n (mirror mobile setup) — still on the roadmap from last session
