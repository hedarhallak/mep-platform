# Constrai — Session Handoff

> **Single source of truth for new conversations.** This file is REPLACED (not appended) at the end of every session.
> Last updated: May 11, 2026 ~13:00 UTC — **All Section 91 leak rotations COMPLETE.** Today's session was a marathon: 5 code/docs PRs + 6 secret rotations + 2 dead-env-var deletions + full Resend cutover (verified end-to-end) + JWT_SECRET rotation + first-ever kernel reboot (which uncovered pm2 startup wasn't configured → fixed, Pitfall #32). Phase 5 closed, Email migration cutover deployed (24h watch ongoing). **Next task: Phase 6 — Frontend tenant context + branding** OR `SENDGRID_API_KEY` decommission (after May 12 ~12:00 UTC).

## How to start a new session (Hedar — copy this one line)

```
استكمال Constrai. اطلب مجلد C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\mep-site-backend-fixed\mep-fixed (request_cowork_directory)، اقرأ HANDOFF.md من المجلد، اتبع التعليمات فيه بالحرف.
```

---

## Bootstrap protocol (Claude — follow this exactly)

When you receive the one-line command above:

1. **Request folder access** via `request_cowork_directory` for `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\mep-site-backend-fixed\mep-fixed`.
2. **Read these 4 files** (use the Read tool, NOT bash):
   - `HANDOFF.md` (this file)
   - `CLAUDE.md` (working rules)
   - `DECISIONS.md` (read ONLY the latest 2-3 sections referenced below — DON'T read the whole 11,000+ line file). Today's session added Sections 91 + 92 + 93.
   - `RECOVERY.md` Section 2.4 only if relevant
3. **Echo this exact line** as the first line of your reply:
   ```
   (محادثة استكمال — قرأت HANDOFF.md + DECISIONS.md Sections 91/92/93, all leak rotations done, next is Phase 6 frontend tenant branding)
   ```
4. **Confirm the next task** in 1-2 lines.
5. **Ask if Hedar is ready to start**, then wait.

## Next task: Phase 6 — Frontend tenant context + branding

Section 85 architecture queued Phase 6 to follow Phase 5 (which closed today). The Phase 6 deliverable:

> **Per-tenant branding in the tenant React app.** Each company gets its own logo + accent colors, loaded from the backend on app boot. The admin portal stays unbranded (cross-tenant tool).

**Scope (proposed; refine at session start):**

1. **DB schema (migration 014?):** add `companies.brand_color` (varchar 7, hex) + `companies.brand_logo_url` (text, S3/Spaces URL or relative path). Backfill with defaults for existing tenants.
2. **Backend endpoint:** `GET /api/companies/:id/branding` — returns `{ brand_color, brand_logo_url, company_name }`. Public route (no auth) so login screen can load branding before user is authenticated.
3. **Frontend bootstrap:** on app load, resolve tenant from hostname → fetch branding → apply CSS variables (`--color-primary`, `--color-primary-dark`) + swap logo. Login screen shows tenant branding instead of generic Constrai.
4. **Admin upload UI** (probably a Phase 6 sub-piece): tenant admin uploads logo + picks accent color. Stored in DigitalOcean Spaces. Saved to `companies.brand_*` fields.
5. **Mobile app:** later — out of scope for the first PR.

**Out of scope for Phase 6:**
- Multi-region branding (each region = different logo). Not needed today.
- Theming the admin portal per SA preference. Admin stays unbranded.
- Per-user (vs per-tenant) preferences. Tenant-level only.

**Suggested first step at next session:** discuss the schema migration shape (single new table vs columns on existing companies table) + the upload pipeline (DigitalOcean Spaces direct vs. backend-proxied).

### Alternative: SendGrid decommission (after May 12 ~12:00 UTC)

If May 12 has come around and Resend has logged a healthy spread of backend-generated emails (invite, PO, dispatch, foreman) over the past 24 hours, this is the perfect 15-minute task to clear the SendGrid surface:

1. SSH to prod, `sed -i '/^SENDGRID_API_KEY=/d' /var/www/mep/.env`, `pm2 restart mep-backend`, verify SA login + a Resend-routed email path.
2. SendGrid dashboard → Settings → API Keys → delete the Constrai key.
3. SendGrid dashboard → Settings → Account → optionally delete the sub-user.
4. Update HANDOFF "Credentials" section to remove SendGrid entries.

---

## Backlog items still open

- **`routes/project_trades.js`** redundant top-level `router.use(auth)`. Low-priority.
- **pg DeprecationWarning** — "Calling client.query() when the client is already executing a query". Hygiene PR opportunity.
- **Coverage threshold ratchet** — total test suite is 44+ files now. Run `TEST_DATABASE_URL=… npx jest --coverage` and ratchet if drift ≥3 pp.
- **Stale GitHub blob `0512476`** — remains in object DB until GC; no action needed (all credentials inside revoked).
- **Mapbox `Default public token`** — unused, can't delete (Mapbox UI limitation). Benign.
- **Apple Passwords → OneDrive migration of all credential entries** — Hedar uses OneDrive `Constrai Keys` folder, not Apple Passwords. Earlier HANDOFFs referenced "Apple Passwords entries" inaccurately. Update next time you do a credentials inventory pass.

## Active credentials & secrets locations

All credentials live in **OneDrive `Constrai Keys` folder** (`C:\Users\Lenovo\OneDrive\Desktop\Constrai Keys\`). Files:

| Secret | File | Last rotated |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Origin Certificate (May 7, 2041) | `Cloudflare Origin Certificate.txt` | 2026-05-11 |
| Cloudflare Origin Private Key | `Cloudflare Private Key.txt` | 2026-05-11 |
| Resend API key (`Constrai Prod 2026-05-11-v2`) | `Resend API key 2026-05-11.txt` | 2026-05-11 (rotated mid-session) |
| `mepuser_super` DB pw | (saved this session in OneDrive) | 2026-05-11 |
| `mepuser` DB pw | (saved this session in OneDrive) | 2026-05-11 |
| `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (`Constrai Prod 2026-05-11`) | `Mapbox token 2026-05-11.txt` | 2026-05-11 |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `JWT_SECRET 2026-05-11.txt` | 2026-05-11 |

Prod `/var/www/mep/.env` is in sync with all of the above.

Cost inventory + DigitalOcean Spaces + Apple Developer keys: see `RECOVERY.md`.

## Critical pitfalls (encoded from Sections 86 + 87 + 88 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 93)

1. **Bash sandbox file sync lag** — use Read tool to verify file state.
2. **Edit tool can silently lose changes** — Read each file immediately after Edit.
3. **Notepad adds `.txt` to filenames** silently. Use VS Code.
4. **Cloudflare cert/key copy can be swapped** — `head -3` to verify.
5. **CRLF + UTF-8 BOM break PEM parsing** — `dos2unix` before installing.
6. **`npm install --omit=dev` fails on husky** — use `--ignore-scripts`.
7. **Untracked file on server blocks `git pull`** — stash or delete first.
8. **PR auto-merge can flip dependency order** — manual control between dependent PRs.
9. **`gh pr merge` requires branch up-to-date** — rebase + `--force-with-lease`.
10. **Don't open a new session before previous PRs merge** — wait for Merged status.
11. **Cherry-picking can cross feature branches** — verify `git branch --show-current` first.
12. **Replace this file at end of session, don't append** — long history goes in DECISIONS.md.
13. **RLS doesn't apply to BYPASSRLS roles** — use `SET LOCAL ROLE mepuser` in tests.
14. **CI uses `postgres` role for tests** — switch via `SET LOCAL ROLE`.
15. **`git checkout main` fails silently with dirty tree** — stash first.
16. **`git stash pop` can lose cleanly-applied files when there's a conflict elsewhere** — verify content after pop.
17. **PowerShell's bare `>` redirect uses UTF-16 with BOM** — always `Out-File -Encoding utf8`.
18. **GitHub web "Update branch" button creates duplicate squash commits** — never touch UI for a merged branch.
19. **`openssl rand -hex N` over `-base64 N`** — hex is URL-safe.
20. **Read untracked WIP files before writing fresh code** — `git status` + Read first.
21. **`middleware/permissions.js can()` uses `pool.query` directly** ✅ CLOSED by 89-D.
22. **Per-request transaction middleware MUST commit BEFORE the response is flushed** — override `res.end`.
23. **`try { INSERT } catch { handle dup }` patterns DO NOT survive inside a tenantDb transaction** — use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING *`.
24. **Orphan-account 401 from tenantDb is the cross-route contract** — update tests accordingly.
25. **SUPER_ADMIN seedUser needs an explicit 8+ char PIN** — `seedUser({ role: 'SUPER_ADMIN', pin: 'sa-pin-1234' })`.
26. **Tests pinning transitional stage contracts** — label with future-migration reference.
27. (reserved — folded into #28.)
28. **Strict RLS breaks pre-tenant queries** ✅ CLOSED by 90-G. `authPool = superPool || pool`.
29. **NEVER `git add -A` in branches touching credentials** (Section 91) — explicit paths. `.gitignore` MUST cover `.secrets/`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`.
30. **NEVER paste `.env` contents/screenshots in any chat** (Section 91) — use `read -rsp` + `sed -i`. Mask via `sed 's/=.*/=***/'`.
31. **Sed mask regex MUST include underscores** (Section 92.5) — universal form: `sed -E 's/=[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$/=***/'`. Eyeball masked output before sharing.
32. **Verify `pm2-root.service` is enabled BEFORE any planned reboot** (NEW — Section 93.4, May 11, 2026). The first kernel reboot of the prod Droplet took prod down for ~2 min because `pm2 startup` was never run — no systemd unit to spawn the pm2 daemon on boot. Fixed via `pm2 startup systemd -u root --hp /root && pm2 save`. **Convention going forward:** run `systemctl is-enabled pm2-root` before any planned reboot; expected output `enabled`. If `disabled` or `not-found`, run the `pm2 startup` + `pm2 save` pair BEFORE rebooting. Also: after ANY new `pm2 start` of a new app, run `pm2 save` immediately so the dump captures the new process.

## Workflow rules (CLAUDE.md highlights)

- **One command at a time** in chat — one PowerShell or bash block per turn.
- **Flow diagrams only for substantive architectural discussions** — not routine ops.
- **Levantine Arabic in chat** — `شو`, `هلق`, `بدك`, `لازم`, `منيح`, `بسيط`. `شغّل` (not `ركض`). Masculine address.
- **GitHub CLI + auto-merge** — `gh pr create --fill --base main ; gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`.
- **ALWAYS delete the local branch after merge** — `--delete-branch` only removes the remote.
- **Don't put `"تم"` inside PowerShell blocks** — Hedar types it manually.
- **File-based log convention for large output** — `Out-File -Encoding utf8` (NEVER bare `>`).
- **DECISIONS.md is the archive**, not the entry point.
- **Testing pool-vs-role interactions** — `jest.isolateModules` with `process.env.DATABASE_URL` rewritten.
- **Explicit `git add <file>` paths** for any credential-adjacent commit (Section 91).
- **Universal sed mask** — `sed -E 's/=[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$/=***/'` (Section 92.5).
- **Verify pm2 systemd unit before reboots** — `systemctl is-enabled pm2-root` (Section 93.4).

## End-of-session checklist (Claude must run BEFORE saying "session done")

1. **All work merged to main** — `gh pr list --state open` empty.
2. **HANDOFF.md replaced** — update timestamp, latest-deployed, last-merged, migration table, next-task. Add new pitfalls.
3. **DECISIONS.md** has a new Section for any non-trivial work.
4. **Push HANDOFF + DECISIONS** as small docs PR. Wait for merge.
5. **Brief Hedar** with: "PR merged, HANDOFF updated, next session starts on <X>."
